 * Handles different kinds of lists
 1. Bulleted
 2. Numbered
    - You can nest them as far as you want.
    - It's pretty decent about figuring out which level of list it
      is supposed to be on.
      - You don't need to change bullet markers to start a new list.
 3. Lettered
    A. Finally handles lettered lists
    B. Upper and lower case both work
       a) Here's an example
       b) I've been meaning to add this for some time.
    C. HTML without CSS can't specify how ordered lists should be
      indicated, so it will be a numbered list in most browsers.
 4. Definition lists (see below)
* Doesn't screw up mail-ish things
* Spots preformated text

               It just needs to have enough whitespace in the line.
      Surrounding blank lines aren't necessary.  If it sees enough
      whitespace in a line, it preformats it.  How much is enough?
      Set it yourself at command line if you want.

* You can append a file automatically to all converted files.  This
 is handy for adding signatures to your documents.

* Deals with paragraphs decently.

 Looks for short lines in the middle of paragraphs and keeps them
 short with the use of breaks (<BR>).  How short the lines need to
 be is configurable.

 Unhyphenates split words that are in the middle of para-
 graphs.  Let me know if trailing punctuation isn't handled "prop-
 erly".  It should be.

 One can also have multi-paragraph list items, like this one.

* Puts anchors at all headers and, if you're using the mail header
 features, at the beginning of each mail message.  The anchor names
 for headings are based on guessed section numbers.  
 - You can turn off this option too, if you don't like it.

* Groks Mosaic-style "formatted text" headers (like the one below)

* Can hyperlink things according to a dictionary file.
 The sample dictionary handles URLs like http://www.aigeek.com/ and
 <http://www.katspace.com/> and also shows how to do simpler
 things such as linking the word txt2html the first time it appeared.
* One can also use the link-dictionary to define custom tags, for
 example using the star character to indicate *italics*.
